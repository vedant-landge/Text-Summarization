# Text-Summarization

The aim of this project is to create a summary of a particular text. There are wide-scale applications for this. 
Elderly people can get help with a talk-back system that summarizes the news, which they ideally see in 3 hours, within minutes. 
We can even use this as a tool to help enhance the experience of meetings. Most of the time, when people are attending a meeting, like in an office per se, people tend to make messy keywords when their superiors ask them to jot down the key takeaways. 
Text summarization can help people with understanding the key takeaways and never missing on them.
Another field of application for text summarization is to help people understand what a person is trying to say in a completely different language. 
This can even help us bridge the language barrier.
